# Who is Aon?

## About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @aon aka Agustin Aon.
- 🌊 I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
- ✍🏾 I am an Electronics Engineer, self-taught programmer with a passion for tech.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer. I'd love help build the new web 3.0 too. I'm learning how to make smart contracts as well!

## Skills
### Python 🐍
Python was the first language I learned, and the one I'm the most proficient with. I've built plenty of projects with it and would recommend it to everyone as a starting language.

### C/C++ 🔌
I learned C/C++ programming microcontrollers in college. I love how you can interact directly with the hardware below and how you're pretty much in control of everything. Very interesting and challenging.

### JavaScript/React 🌐
I'm currently learning React from a very comprehensive course on Udemy. In this repository you'll see some of the projects I've developed.

### Solidity 🗃
I'm currently learning Solidity and building projects from it. You'll find some of them in this repo. Fascinating language with its own set of limitations and challenges.

### Verilog/SystemVerilog ⚙️
I learned design and verification of RTL for VLSI using Verilog and SystemVerilog on Marvell. Here, I gathered the best practices of the industry, including verification using UVM.

### Git 🚩
Learned Git a couple of years ago and can't go back. I track every project I create, collaborative or not. It's truly amazing.

### Latex 📜
Amazing tool for building beautiful and professional documents. Almost uninstalled MS Word. Almost.
